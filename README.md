### How can municipalities prioritise locations to address heat stress in managing public space?
Global warming is intensifying the frequency and severity of heatwaves. Additionally, the urban heat island (UHI) effect also intensifies, which is driven by configuration of city, impermeable materials, and human activities. 

There is growing knowledge about the causes, consequences, and solutions for urban heat stress. In response, there are emerging municipal heat plans in the Netherlands, such as the Amsterdam Hitteplan (GGD Amsterdam, 2024) and the Utrecht Heat Plan (Utrecht Municipality, 2022), which aim to translate research into actionable design strategies. However, there is still a gap between research and policymaking and challenge in interpreting raw data.

​After experiencing record-breaking temperatures of 40°C in 2019, Amsterdam became more aware of heat-related health risks and introduced policies and strategies to address heat stress. However, the city still struggles to translate these policies into data-driven decisions due to a lack of reliable heat stress data, neighborhood-level demographics, and building-specific health insights. 

Our research takes an interdisciplinary approach, focusing on developing a decision support tool for prioritising locations for heat stress intervention, which utilises data-driven and knowledge-driven decision.

Through conversations, interviews, and co-creation sessions with municipal employees, a decision support tool was conceptualised to address the complexities of urban heat stress in Amsterdam. ​Holistically analysing heat stress through the 5 Ps—Planet, People, Prosperity, Partnership, and Peace—helps highlight which criteria should be prioritised. Building on these insights, the decision support tool combines data on heat, shade, and pedestrian flows.

By integrating the three dimensions mentioned above, the heat stress risk at the street level can be calculated, thereby helping to identify the areas requiring the highest priority for intervention. This data output is presented through a tangible decision support tool.
